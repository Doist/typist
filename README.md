Typist is the mighty [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/)-based rich-text editor that powers Doist products, which can also be used for displaying content in a read-only fashion. Typist also supports a plain-text mode, and comes with HTML/Markdown serializers.

> **Note**
>
> This project is not attempting to be an all-purpose rich-text editor. Whilst everyone is welcome to fork or use this package in their own products, development decisions are centered around Doist product requirements.
